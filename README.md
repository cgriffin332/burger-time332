## Description

For this project, I have created a burger logger app using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This app follows an MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data, while using Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Once the user has clicked the link, they are navigated to the main home page with a few seed data burgers already present.

New burgers to devour can be added by typing the name of each burger into the form and clicking "Add Burger".

The user can then devour a burger by clicking the "Devour!" button, and it will then move to the devoured list.

Burgers can be deleted by clicking the corresponding "Delete" button, and the process can go on and on.
